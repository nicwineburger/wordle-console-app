# Wordle Console App

This is a very basic console application to do some Wordle things. Runs on .NET 5 using `dotnet run`

This application can currently 
- Play Wordle
- Run a Wordle Solver
- Run a random word self-solve
- Batch run n number of self-solves and plot the cumulative moving average of the number of guesses per solve

More to come?
